# physics2d-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eviltak/physics2d-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eviltak/physics2d-rs)

Yet another 2D physics engine, but with Iron power.

physics2d-rs is an educational project accompanying [my 2D physics article series](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1029858/Making-a-D-Physics-Engine-The-Math) and does not intend to compete with the likes of [nphysics](https://github.com/sebcrozet/nphysics/), but can still be used as part of 2D games and simulations post the initial release.

## Features
Coming soon!

## Compilation
The project is _very_ young and does not achieve much in the current state. To check its progress, simply run any one of the available examples.

## Examples
The examples use the [sfml crate](https://crates.io/crates/sfml), and hence are dependent on both the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [CSFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) development libraries. macOS and GNU/Linux users should have both packages available with their respective package managers.

To run an example, use the Cargo `run` command:

    cargo run --example=EXAMPLE
