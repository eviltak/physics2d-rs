Yet another 2D physics engine, but with Iron power.

physics2d-rs is an educational project accompanying [my 2D physics article series](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1029858/Making-a-D-Physics-Engine-The-Math) and does not intend to compete with the likes of [nphysics](https://github.com/sebcrozet/nphysics/), but can still be used as part of 2D games and simulations post the initial release.

## Features
For the moment, brute-force collision detection and resolution (with friction) between bodies is only supported. To check the project's current progress, take a look at the available examples. New examples are generally created for every major feature addition.

## Examples
The examples use the [`sfml` crate](https://crates.io/crates/sfml), and hence are dependent on both the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [CSFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) development libraries. macOS and GNU/Linux users should have both packages available with their respective package managers. Windows users should follow [these](https://github.com/jeremyletang/rust-sfml/wiki/How-to-use-rust-sfml-on-Windows) instructions to set up the `sfml` crate.

To run an example, use the Cargo `run` command:

    cargo run --example=EXAMPLE-NAME
